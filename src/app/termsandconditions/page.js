          DISCLAIMER/USER AGREEMENT: Stocks, Options, Binary options, Forex and
          Future trading has large potential rewards, but also large potential
          risk. You must be aware of the risks and be willing to accept them in
          order to invest in stock, binary options or futures markets. Don’t
          trade with money you can’t afford to lose especially with leveraged
          instruments such as binary options trading, futures trading or forex
          trading. The past performance of any trading system or methodology is
          not necessarily indicative of future results. You could lose all of
          your money fast due too: poor market trading conditions, mechanical
          error, emotional induced errors, news surprises and earnings releases.

          1. Trading is a risky affair.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Forex is an extremely risky affair and is not meant to be visualized
          as retirement funds. So, it is most suitable for customers who
          <br />
          <br />
          Understand the risks and are willing to undertake it. Financially
          capable of standing losses that can even exceed the deposited amount.{" "}
          <br />
          <br />
          Hence, a proper understanding of the risk is necessary prior to
          trading in forex.

          2. High leverage and low margin can culminate in quick loss
        </h2>
        <p>
          Owing to price changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange contracts
          and cross currency contracts, the combination of high leverage and low
          margin can lead to significant losses. The initial margin can be small
          when you compare it with the value of foreign currency and so the
          transactions can be leveraged. Customers need to maintain the minimum
          margin requirements for the open position at all times. It is the duty
          of the customer to keep an eye and monitor his net outstanding
          balance. If the minimum requirement is not maintained, we hold the
          right to liquidate all open positions. Similarly, leverages too can
          lead to high gains as well as losses.
        </p>

          3. Risk-reducing orders and strategies
        </h2>
        <p>
          Orders like stop loss orders or stop limit orders that aim at limiting
          the losses to some upper amount may not be effective because
          sometimes, it becomes impossible to execute such orders owing to the
          market condition.

        <p>
          Before starting to trade, you must get a clear detail of all your
          commission and fees and related charges as well. You must be aware
          that profit and losses that are incurred in foreign currency
          denominated contracts will get affected by the changes in rates of
          foreign currency and the cost of converting from one currency to
          another will have to be borne by you when calculating net profit and
          losses.
