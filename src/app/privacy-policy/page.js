        <p>
          We value our privacy immensely. This is the reason we have developed a
          privacy policy in such way that we can serve our needs and so we do
          not collect or use any of your personal information, more than the
          amount we need to complete our stated objectives and other related
          purposes. Presented below is an outline of our privacy policy and
          standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to complete our objectives and related purposes, we may
          require our clients to provide us with direct identifiers such as
          name, email address and phone number. During the time of collecting
          personal information, we make it a point to identify the main purpose
          for which we are asking the information. If we put the information to
          any other use, we will take the consent from the specified individual
          and even the law bodies, if required. We do not collect and store
          Credit/Debit card information of our members. We do not collect
          genetic, biometric or data concerning health.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will not sell, share, or otherwise distribute Personal Data to
          third parties except as provided in this Privacy Policy. For every
          transfer we need to make, we will make sure that we have the consent
          of the specified individual. We retain our right to transfer
          information when this is necessary to comply with legal obligations
          that apply to us, in which case we do not need consent, but we will
          inform the specified individual.
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure the security and confidentiality of Personal Data that we
          collect online, we use data networks protected, by industry standard
          firewall and password protection. In the course of handling Personal
          Data, we take measures reasonably designed to protect that information
          from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or
          destruction and against other unlawful forms of processing. We make a
          point to keep personal information safe and it will not be accessed by
          unauthorized users.
        </p>
        <p>
          We retain the information only up till the task is not accomplished.
          Once our purpose is accomplished, we make sure we do not retain the
          information much longer. We may retain Personal Data, if we have to
          comply with legal or regulatory requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever we process Personal Data, we take reasonable steps to ensure
          that Personal Data is kept accurate and up-to date for the purposes
          for which it was collected. If you wish to contact us regarding the
          use of personal information, or to object in whole or in part to the
          processing, you can email us at easypips11@gmail.com . If you have
          provided consent, you may wish to withdraw it at any time. You may
          request to access your Personal Data as processed by us, to ask for
          correction, erasure or to request portability, where applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are willing to disclose out policies and practices related to
          management of personal information to all our customers who ask for
          clarification.
        </p>
        <h2 className="font-semibold">Changes in our Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. When
          we make any modifications to our Privacy Policy, we will notify you
          and/or put a notification in a place on our website that we find
          appropriate. This is so you are aware of what information we collect,
          how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, that we disclose
          it.
